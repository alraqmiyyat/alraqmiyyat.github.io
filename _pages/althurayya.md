The new working version of the al-Ṯurayyā project includes the gazetteer (<i>al-Ṯurayyā Gazetteer</i>, or <i>al-Thurayyā Gazetteer</i>), and the geospatial model of the early Islamic world. Both parts of the project are still under development.

**Gazetteer**: The gazetteer currently includes over 2,000 toponyms and almost as many route sections georeferenced from Georgette Cornu’s *Atlas du monde arabo-islamique à l'époque classique: IXe-Xe siècles* (Leiden: Brill, 1983).
 
**Geospatial model** consists of a two main modules (*work in progress*) which plot 1) routes and itineraries of various complexity; and 2) networks of reachable places from selected centers.

**Note on the transliteration scheme:** The website uses a somewhat unconventional transliteration system, which was developed to facilitate computational analysis. Unlike more traditional transliteration schemes the current one uses one-to-one letter representation, with every Arabic letter transcribed distinctively, which allows for an automatic conversion between transliteration and the Arabic script. The overall scheme should be easily recognizable to Arabists (new letters are as follows: *ŧ* for *tāʾ marbuṭaŧ*; *ã* for dagger *alif*; and *á* for *alif maqṣūraŧ*).
