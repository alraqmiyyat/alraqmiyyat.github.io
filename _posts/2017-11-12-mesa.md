The [Middle East Studies Association (MESA)](https://mesana.org/) celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. Although it is not as large as such associations as AAR and AHA, it is very dear to most of us who are engaged in the study of Middle East. Those who attended the annual meeting in Boston must have seen an attempt to visualize academic genealogies of scholars of Middle East, which sounds like a very interesting idea, but will take forever to realize. At the moment the genealogy looks like unconnected snowflakes (here is Franz Rosenthal's [snowflake of students](../images/mesa_network/genealogy.jpg)),[^fr] but we all realize that the real life is way more complicated and more interesting than that (<hint>Perhaps, MESA should add another field to academic profiles, where we’d need to provide the name of our adviser(s?!)—or, better, the entire dissertation committee</hint>—then we will be able to recreate a living genealogy of the field with all its complexities and subtleties).

While the genealogy project is too far away from its maturity, we do have some other interesting data through which we can get a glimpse into the academic community that grew around MESA: we can use programs of annual meetings--in combination with academic profiles of MESA members (and, perhaps later, abstracts of their papers)--to gauge whether and how we are connected with each other across the field, how we form collegial communities and maintain them, and how these communities take new shapes in reaction to internal developments in the academy and to external political and social factors. The program data is limited in many ways, as it does not capture such connections as who attends panels, who engages into discussions with panelists, nor does it anywhere close to revealing who we hang out with between panels at the most attended areas of the conference. Additionally, only a limited number of programs is relatively accessible at the moment and our insight can go back in time only 8 years (2009--2017; all data used below is openly available at the official [MESA Website](http://mesana.org/)).

Below you can find explanations of how the network was generated as well as summaries for each major intellectual community that can be identified in the data. [You can also browse the network and find yourself there.](../projects/mesa_network/)

# On data and method

The data has been collected from the official MESA website—only what is openly accessible has been included into the dataset (in other words, if you chose not to make your profile public, your data is not in the dataset). The data has been downloaded with `wget` and then reformatted with a series of scripts written in `python`. The data was then reformatted into a network model where scholars are connected through all the panels and sessions they participated in together. The `weight` is based on the number co-panelists. Scholars with multiple roles (such as an Organizer and a Presenter) were given more `weight`, to stress their active engagement. The network visualization has been built with [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), whose community detection algorithm was used to identify closely connected groups of scholars, or*intellectual communities*; the results were saved into an interactive network using [Sigma.js](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/sigmajs-exporter/) plugin. Reports were then algorithmically generated for all major *intellectual communities* (with the size of at least 1%) using `R`, `R Markdown`, and the [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. Some data cleaning—mainly to unify different spellings—was done with [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/).

# What’s in community reports?

As stated above, communities were identified with the community detection algorithm in Gephi. Reports summarize formal descriptions that MESA members provide in their open academic profiles at the MESA website (disciplines, subfields, geographical areas of specialization, working languages, and degree granting institutions). Some members preferred not to share their profiles online, so their data was not included. In general, the most salient characteristics of communities offer a decent idea of what a given community is about. For example, **Group 12** appears to be mostly about politics in modern Middle East; **Group 15**—mostly about premodern Islamic history and Islamic studies; **Group 1**—mostly about Ottoman studies, and so on.

Interestingly, there are multiple communities with the same—or, at least, comparable—thematic/subject foci, but they differ by alma maters, which shows that the formation of academic communities is tied to brick-and-mortar institutions (For example, **Group 1** and **Group 24** both appear to focus on Ottoman studies, but most of the scholars from the first group have degrees from American institutions, while the second one is dominated by scholars with degrees from Turkish institutions.

The networks of specific scholars often cross into multiple communities.

The most salient features of each community are statistical outliers on the high end of data distribution: i.e., items whose frequencies are higher than `Q3 * 1.5` (items with frequency 1 were removed before determining quartiles).

Reports are organized by the size of communities (from largest to smallest).
